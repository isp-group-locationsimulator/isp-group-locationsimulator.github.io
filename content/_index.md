LocationSimulator is an Android app for the training 
of Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) personnel in the use of 
acousting person location equipment.

The smartphone(-s) the app is running on can be hidden
in a training location, and the personnel will be able to
locate the phone by its periodic vibration and/or acoustic
signals.

This app is an alternative to purpose-build knocker devices
that can be used with very little effort and very low cost.
