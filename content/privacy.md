the University of Lübeck (*The Team*):
- Felix Winkler
- Florian Vierkant

- Sebastian Guhl
- Steffen Marbach

Another group of students implemented more functionality that adds to the application:

- Lars Fockenga
- Tom Boje
- Brian Rickert

They were supported by Juljan Bouchagiar and Lars Vosteen of the Institute of Software Engineering 
and Programming Languages at the University of Lübeck, as well as 
Jan Lukas Matyssek and Joshua Wiedekopf, who are volunteers in the 
German Federal Agency for Technical Relief.
